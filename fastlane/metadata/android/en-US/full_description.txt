A minimal offline tool for tracking problem-solving proficiency through color-coded grids.

- No problem content storage, no explanations, no scheduling algorithms
- Visual proficiency tracking: gray = not attempted, red (light to dark) = needs practice, green = mastered
- Mark each attempt as correct/incorrect: incorrect deepens red, correct lightens it, light red turns green when correct
- No account required, no ads, no tracking, fully offline

Perfect for exam prep workflows where you want to focus on solving problems, not managing a complex learning system.
